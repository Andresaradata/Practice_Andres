    "# Hackathon: From Raw Data to ML-Ready Dataset\n",
    "## Insight-Driven EDA and End-to-End Feature Engineering on Airbnb Data Using pandas and Plotly\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Hackathon?\n",
    "\n",
    "A hackathon is a fast-paced, collaborative event where participants use data and technology to solve a real problem end-to-end.  \n",
    "In this hackathon, you will work with a **real-world Airbnb dataset** and complete two interconnected goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Produce a **high-quality exploratory data analysis (EDA)** using `pandas` and `plotly`, extracting meaningful insights, trends, and signals from the data.  \n",
    "- Design and deliver a **clean, feature-rich, ML-ready dataset** that will serve as the foundation for a follow-up hackathon focused on building and evaluating machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to **get the most out of the data**: uncover structure and patterns through EDA, and engineer informative features (numerical, categorical, temporal, textual (TF–IDF), and optionally image-based) to maximize the predictive power of the final dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-success\">\n",
    "<b>About the Dataset</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Context</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "The data comes from <a href=\"https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/\">Inside Airbnb</a>, an open project that publishes detailed, regularly updated datasets for cities around the world.  \n",
    "Each city provides three main CSV files:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>listings.csv</b> — property characteristics, host profiles, descriptions, amenities, etc.  \n",
    "- <b>calendar.csv</b> — daily availability and pricing information for each listing.  \n",
    "- <b>reviews.csv</b> — guest feedback and textual reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "These datasets offer a rich view of the short-term rental market, including availability patterns, pricing behavior, host attributes, and guest sentiment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Inspiration</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "Your ultimate objective is to create a dataset suitable for training a machine learning model that predicts whether a specific Airbnb listing will be <b>available on a given date</b>, using property attributes, review information, and host characteristics.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Task</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Using one city of your choice from Inside Airbnb, create an end-to-end pipeline that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Loads and explores the raw data (EDA).  \n",
    "2. Engineers features (numerical, categorical, temporal, textual TF–IDF, etc.).  \n",
    "3. Builds a unified ML-ready dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Please remember to add comments explaining your decisions. Comments help us understand your thought process and ensure accurate evaluation of your work. This assignment requires code-based solutions—**manually calculated or hard-coded results will not be accepted**. Thoughtful comments and visualizations are encouraged and will be highly valued.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write your solution directly in this notebook, modifying it as needed.\n",
    "- Once completed, submit the notebook in **.ipynb** format via Moodle.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<b>Collaboration Requirement: Git & GitHub</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "You must collaborate with your team using a **shared GitHub repository**.  \n",
    "Your use of Git is part of the evaluation. We will specifically look at:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Commit quality (clear messages, meaningful steps).  \n",
    "- Balanced participation across team members.  \n",
    "- Use of branches.  \n",
    "- Ability to resolve merge conflicts appropriately.  \n",
    "- A clean, readable project history that reflects real collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good Git practice is **part of your grade**, not optional.\n",

    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Hints</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Text columns often carry substantial predictive power, use text-vectorization methods to extract meaningful features.  \n",
    "- Make sure all columns use appropriate data types (categorical, numeric, datetime, boolean). Correct dtypes help prevent subtle bugs and improve performance.  \n",
    "- Feel free to enrich the dataset with any additional information you consider useful: engineered features, external data, derived temporal features, etc.  \n",
    "- If the dataset is too large for your computer, use <code>.sample()</code> to work with a subset while preserving the logic of your pipeline.  \n",
    "- Plotly offers a wide variety of powerful visualizations, experiment creatively, but always begin with a clear analytical question: *What insight am I trying to uncover with this plot?*\n",

    "# Final Summary – What We Achieved with the Airbnb Data\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Main Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The main result of this work is a **single, clean dataset (`df_final`) ready for Machine Learning**, where each row represents one Airbnb listing and each column is a meaningful, numeric feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "This final dataset combines:\n",
    "- Static information about the listing.\n",
    "- Time/season patterns from the calendar.\n",
    "- Text information from descriptions and reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "All this is prepared so that tomorrow we can plug it directly into ML models.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. What the Final Dataset Contains\n",
    "\n",
    "In `df_final` we ended up with four big types of features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Numeric features (listing‑level)\n",
    "- Cleaned price (`price_clean`), minimum nights, number of reviews, etc.\n",
    "- New numeric variables that summarize behaviour, e.g.:\n",
    "  - Estimated revenue for minimum stay (`rev_min_stay`).\n",
    "  - Log‑transformed price (`log_price`) to reduce skewness.\n",
    "\n",
    "→ These columns tell the model “how this listing is priced and behaves in general”.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Categorical features (listing‑level, one‑hot encoded)\n",
    "- Variables like room type, property type, neighbourhood, etc.\n",
    "- Converted into 0/1 columns (one‑hot), e.g.:\n",
    "  - `room_type_Entire home/apt`\n",
    "  - `room_type_Private room`\n",
    "\n",
    "→ These columns tell the model “what kind of listing this is and where it is located”.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Temporal / availability features (from calendar)\n",
    "- Overall availability rate: how often a listing is available during the period.\n",
    "- Seasonal availability: availability in Winter, Summer, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "→ These columns tell the model “how demand and occupancy change for this listing across the year”.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Text‑based features (TF–IDF)\n",
    "- From the listing description and, optionally, from guest reviews.\n",
    "- TF–IDF turns text into numeric signals about the words that best describe each listing or the guest experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "→ These columns tell the model “what is being said about this listing and how it is described”.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Why This Matters for the Next Phase\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to this pipeline, we now have:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **single, consistent table** (`df_final`) instead of three separate raw datasets.\n",
    "- Features that are:\n",
    "  - Numeric (no raw text or messy strings).\n",
    "  - Already cleaned and engineered to capture useful patterns.\n",
    "- A structure that any ML algorithm can use directly (regression, classification, tree‑based models, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words:\n",
    "\n",
    "We transformed raw Airbnb data (listings, calendar, reviews) into a **rich feature matrix** that summarizes:\n",
    "- What each listing is like,\n",
    "- How it is booked over time,\n",
    "- And how it is described and reviewed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly what is needed to build and compare machine learning models in the next hackathon session.\n"
